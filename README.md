# DWRChatbot
Welcome to Our Drinking Water Regulations Chatbot Repo!

This project aims to build a chatbot that is capable of answering user questions about California Drinking Water Regulations. The project will be documented in a paper which will be published in the industry publications if conditions are sufficient.

Project team members include water industry professionals at the California Water Resource Control Boards and California Data Collaborative who are teamed up with students participating in the UCB Data Science Discovery Program.

A pdf copy and a word copy of the regulations can be found in the Regulations folder. Alternatively the regulations can be scraped from the following website:
https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=IE55EDC305B6011EC9451000D3A7C4BC3&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)

The examples folder includes the following code examples:

2. How to Use OpenAI API for Q&A and Chatbot Apps: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6643167-how-to-use-openai-api-for-q-a-and-chatbot-apps
3. How to build an AI that can answer questions about your website: https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings
4. Question answering example notebooks: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/example-notebooks
5. ChatGPT @ Home: Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot application, written by ChatGPT: https://youtu.be/QumfkMQr47M

Student team members are encouraged to review the examples, select one code example, and try to run the codes without errors. Alternatively, students may find and sucessfully run other code examples elsewhere that are even more suitable to this project. The team will discussed results of this exercise and select the most promising code example to customize for this project.
